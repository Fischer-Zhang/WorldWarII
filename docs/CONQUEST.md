# Conquest Mode

Conquest is the strategic wrapper around the tactical hex battles. You pick a
WW2 power, grow and defend a network of regions on a world map, and every attack
or defense launches a **real tactical battle** on that region's terrain — the
same deterministic hex engine used everywhere else, not a separate simulator.

All state lives under `state["conquest"]` in the campaign save and is driven by
`scripts/scenario/conquest_manager.gd`, `conquest_recruit.gd`,
`conquest_supply.gd`, `conquest_battle_setup.gd`, and `data/conquest_map.json`.

## Choosing a power

At the start you pick one of six playable countries (`data/conquest_map.json`
`countries`): **Germany 德國 / Soviet 蘇聯 / USA 美國 / Britain 英國 / Japan 日本 /
China 中國**. The rest are run by the AI; neutral regions are unowned.

## Region parameters

The map has 32 regions. Each region carries these settings:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `owner` | Which power holds it |
| `production` | Per-turn reinforcement base. Starts 1–5, upgradable to **8**. |
| `strength` | The **currency** for recruiting, developing and hiring generals — and the size of the garrison. A freshly captured region starts at `production + 2`. |
| `fort_level` | Fortification 0–**3**. Each level gives **+2 defense** and unlocks fortification support units. `defense_strength = strength + fort_level × 2`. |
| `logistics_level` | Logistics 0–**2**. Drives the `port` / `supply_source` supply nodes. |
| `training_level` | 0–**2**. Newly recruited units in the region start with `+training_level` XP. |
| `port` / `supply_source` | Supply-network nodes (see Supply). |
| `neighbors` / `rail_neighbors` | Adjacency for movement/attack, and rail links for supply. |
| `region_traits` | Region identity hooks such as industrial hubs, fortress lines, rail junctions, airfields, naval bases, jungle fronts and oilfields. These add deterministic tactical pressure when a battle is fought in the region. |

## Per-turn player actions (own regions only)

Selecting one of your regions opens the recruit/manage panel.

### Recruit (徵兵)
Spends `strength` equal to the unit's `cost`. Garrison cap is **8** units.
Advanced unit types are gated behind lounge tech (`requires_tech`) and stay
locked until that tech level is reached. (`ConquestRecruit.recruit`)

### Assign a general (指派將領)
Each garrison unit has a commander dropdown: **無將領 (none)** plus the generals
of that region's **nationality** that can lead the unit's type.

- **Cost (player-side limit):** hiring costs `strength` by quality — **gold 3 /
  silver 2**. Unassigning refunds it. Because strength also buys units, a
  commander trades off against fielding another unit, so the advantage can't
  snowball. This cost applies to the player only.
- One general leads at most one unit per region; the general must match the
  unit's `applies_to` and the region's nationality.
- The general's base bonuses **and** lounge upgrade levels apply in the battle.

AI defenders receive commanders from their own nation for free, scaled by force
size (~1 per 3 units, capped at 2), so every power fields generals.

### Disband (解散)
Removes a unit and refunds its `cost` in strength.

### Develop the region (地區經營)
Four one-time upgrades bought with strength (`ConquestManager.DEVELOPMENT_ACTIONS`):

| Action | Cost | Effect | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Industry 擴建產能 | `4 + current production` | `production +1` (more reinforcement each turn) | production < 8 |
| Fortify 築防整備 | `3` | `fort_level +1` (+2 defense) and an immediate `strength +1` | fort_level < 3 |
| Logistics 整修後勤 | `3` | 1st: opens a `port`; 2nd: establishes a `supply_source` | level < 2 and not yet a supply source |
| Training 軍校訓練 | `4 + current training_level` | `training_level +1`; **new** recruits start with that much bonus XP | level < 2 |

### Transfer (調動)
Move a garrison to an **adjacent friendly** region (source must have a garrison).

### Attack (進攻)
Attack an **adjacent enemy** region (source must have a garrison). This launches
the tactical battle (see Battle handoff).

## Economy & supply (resolved each turn)

- **Strength growth:** a supplied region gains `max(1, production / 2)`; a region
  whose supply is cut gains only `max(0, production / 4)`
  (`conquest_supply.gd`).
- **Supply:** computed by a Dijkstra spread from each owner's `supply_source`
  nodes — rail/port edges cost 1, ordinary edges cost 2, up to 6 hops. Regions
  off the network fall to the reduced growth rate. This is why Logistics
  development matters: it decides which regions reinforce at full rate.

## Strategic objectives

- **Theater objectives (戰區目標, 4 sets):** holding *every* region in a set grants
  **+1 extra reinforcement per turn** to your supplied regions — Atlantic
  Lifeline, Eastern Industry, North Africa Oil, Pacific Perimeter
  (`data/conquest_map.json` `theater_objectives`).
- **Country agendas (`agenda_targets`):** each AI country scores target regions by
  priority (e.g. Germany values Moscow 5, Britain 4, Ukraine 3…), steering which
  regions it attacks.

## Battle handoff (attack / defend)

`ConquestBattleSetup.apply` takes the region's themed scenario template and keeps
its terrain, but replaces factions, rosters and victory:

- **Attacker** wins by **eliminating** the defenders; the **defender** wins by
  **surviving 12 turns** (`DEFENDER_SURVIVE_TURNS`).
- Your garrison deploys with its veteran XP/rank and its assigned generals; the
  defending force is generated from strength and given free national generals.
- The target region's `region_traits` are folded into the battle context. Traits
  can raise generated defender strength, add local support units, or grant
  defender XP. The briefing and conquest detail panel show the active trait
  effects before deployment.
- After the battle, survivors carry their XP/rank back into the garrison record,
  and any secondary-objective strategic effects are applied to the map.

## The AI turn (after "End turn")

1. Every region regenerates strength (formula above).
2. Interior strength consolidates toward the front (`_ai_consolidate`).
3. The AI gets an action budget of `clamp(enemy_regions / 2, 2, 6)`.
4. It resolves the strongest profitable attack repeatedly until the budget runs
   out — **pausing** whenever an AI attack hits one of *your* regions so you can
   fight that defensive battle yourself.
